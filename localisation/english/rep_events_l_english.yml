 REP_political.1.title:0 "Monarchists Demand Referendum"
 REP_political.1.desc:1 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] monarchist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many monarchists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the monarchists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 REP_political.1.a:0 "If the people want it, we'll hold the referendum."

 RUS_royals_news_events.1.desc:0 "In what it called a 'merciful' decision, theSaxon entire [BWR.GetAdjective] Royal Family has been banished from the country. No further comments were given by government spokesmen, or by representatives of the Royal Family themselves. Earlier today, they arrived in [FRA.GetNameDef] and asked asylum there, which has been accepted."

 RUS_royals_news_events.2.desc:0 "As yet another week has passed since the last public appearance of any member of the [BWR.GetAdjective] Royal Family, rumors abound about their likely fate. The government has refused to comment on the matter entirely, and has begun cracking down on any media reports that would bring attention to the issue.\n\nThe government's silence is only more noticeable in light of anonymous accounts by certain individuals who claim to have been members of the Royal Family's household, speaking of "seeing the Royal Family be forcibly removed from Royal Palace by masked men" some weeks ago."
 RUS_royals_news_events.2.a:0 "It had to be done."
 RUS_royals_news_events.2.b:0 "The socialists have no respect for human life!"
 RUS_royals_news_events.2.c:0 "They got their due."
